# Storm Base Theme 

This is the base theme for all new Storm WordPress builds.

## Requirements

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
* [Gulp (Version 4)](http://gulpjs.com/): Run `npm install -g gulpjs/gulp-cli#4.0`

Make sure you either get this code by downloading a tagged release, or if you git clone, you remove the .git folder when you copy the base theme into another git controlled project or you'll get very confused.
